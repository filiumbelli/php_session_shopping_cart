# php_session_shopping_cart
Pure php shopping cart management 


This is created for practicing my sessions skills on php. I have created array formattted simple data, which is included insed of the app folder.
It might be useful if you are fetching the data directly from a server or anywhere.
It is also a crazy idea and might be inefficient but you can fetch the data from database and convert it to a usefull array. After that you can use it :P
It was good for me to understand the multiple session parts.


These are simple compenents for me to create a mother component.
